# OpenXR-Registry

The OpenXR-Registry repository contains the [OpenXRâ„¢](https://www.khronos.org/openxr)
API and Extension Registry, including generated specifications and
reference pages, and reference cards. The sources for these documents are
found in the separate <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-Docs> repository; this
repository is used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
<https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/> . Commits to the master branch of
OpenXR-Registry will be reflected in the web view.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* `specs/1.0/` - OpenXR 1.0 API specifications and reference pages.
* `specs/0.90/` - OpenXR 0.90 Provisional API specifications and reference pages and API
  reference card.
* `index.php` - toplevel index page for the web view of <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/>.
  This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
